# bp-report-stuff
A buddy press module to allow reporting of objectionable content, spammy users, etc. This is a free - no premium bits - community project. I know that technically, I've not written any code but there seems to be a big need for this project and it would be loads easier if other developers joined in.

How you can contribute:

* If you know BuddyPress/WordPress dev, core coding is always appriciated
* If you know JQuery and front end UI, we need that too
* If you run an install, we will (eventually) need testers.

Fork the heck out of this project and I will do my best to check for contributions as often as possible.
