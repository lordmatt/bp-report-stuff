_When adding a planning topic be sure to use a title that describes both the scope and intention of your proposal._

**What (if anything) is already in place**
Reference anything that already exists if you are proposing changes.

**Applicable best or standard practices**
How are things usually done? What givens have you assumed? Make sure we are in the loop.

**your case for changes to the project.**
Make your case for your proposed planning changes. Upon consensus, the proposal will be added to a milestone.
